## Simon Legg

After leaving school at 16 in order to pursue a career with the Metropolitan Police Service, and I started working for a trade decorators' merchants to earn a bit of money in the interim. At 19 I started volunteering as a Special Constable for the Police as a way to get my foot in the door. I soon discovered that career path was not right for me and my current job selling paint was heading nowhere. I needed a change.

My brother was a huge influence in me getting started with coding; I dabbled with some online courses and fell in love with it. I applied to Makers Academy and fought my way through a highly selective process to become Makers Academy's very first [Tech City Fellow](http://www.techcityfellowship.org). The Makers Academy course has just strengthened my desire to keep coding and to learn awesome new things.


## Skills

#### WHAT ABOUT THE CODING STUFF SIMON?

#### Customer Service

As a sales assistant to both trade and retail customers for 8 years I would regularly interact with people: from retail customers to tradesmen. I was able to build very good relationships with my regular clients to ensure they keep coming back to me.  
As a Special Constable, my 'customers' would vary even more, coming from all walks of life. With people having differing views on how the Police should operate, it was important that I was able to provide a top quality professional service to all: from victims to witnesses, as well as suspects.  

- Commended for my victim and witness care after a robbery occured.  
- Praised for my community-focused attitude at large events including the Lord Mayors' Show and the London Marathon
- Built long-term working client relationships.

#### Working under Pressure

I am able to work calmly in high pressure environments, mainly including public order situations where there was a requirement to 

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Misc

Throughout my life I have been actively involved with volunteer schemes. I would regular assist with the leading of Scout trips as well as being a main instructor in a newly formed City of London Volunteer Police Cadets scheme aimed at detracting 13-18 year olds from neighbouring boroughs from anti-sociable behaviour
