## Simon Legg

At the age of 16 I set out to pursue a career with the City of London Police, and I started working for a trade decorators' merchants to earn a bit of money in the interim. At 19, I started volunteering in my spare time as a Special Constable for the Police as a way to get my foot in the door. I soon discovered that career path was not right for me and my current job, selling paint, was heading nowhere. I needed a change.

My brother was a huge influence in me getting started with coding; I dabbled with some online courses and fell in love with it. I applied to Makers Academy and fought my way through a highly selective process to become Makers Academy's very first ever [Tech City Fellow](http://www.techcityfellowship.org), by sheer motivation and hunger to learn to code.

The Makers Academy course has just strengthened my desire to keep coding and I am so excited to be able to get to a stage where I can contribute to the dev community through open-source projects by continuing to build on and 'leveling up' my coding skills.

I also shamelessly love coding jokes.

## Skills

#### Full stack Developer


When I started Makers Academy I was essentially a completely, squeaky clean slate, however within just 12 weeks I can confidently build an end-to-end web app. Although I am more confident using Ruby-on-Rails I have also used Sinatra & picked up the basics of Express.js after writing my first line of Javascript ever the week before!

I have proven my ability to pick up a new technology in my final project, [**Seekr**](https://github.com/leggsimon/seekr_mobile_app), going from hearing about, to learning about, to building a hybrid mobile app using the Ionic framework within a week.


 - [**Instagram**](https://github.com/leggsimon/instagram-challenge) - a clone of Instagram built using Ruby-on-Rails.
 - [**Seekr**](https://github.com/leggsimon/seekr_mobile_app) - a 'tinder for recruiting' mobile app, built using the Angular.js and Ionic frameworks. My final project of Makers Academy
 - [**Todo manager**](https://github.com/leggsimon/todo_challenge) - a todo list manager built using the Angular.js framework.

#### Customer Service

As a sales assistant to both trade and retail customers for 8 years I would regularly interact with people: from retail customers to tradesmen. I was able to build very good relationships with my regular clients to ensure they keep coming back to me.  
As a Special Constable, my 'customers' would vary even more, coming from all walks of life. With people having differing views on how the Police should operate, it was important that I was able to provide a top quality professional service to all: from victims to witnesses, as well as suspects.  

This experience working with customers has made me able to identify their problems, develop solutions with them and deliver results.

- Commended for my victim and witness care after a robbery occurred.  
- Praised for my community-focused attitude at large events including the Lord Mayors' Show and the London Marathon
- Built long-term working client relationships.

#### Working under Pressure

I am able to work calmly in high pressure environments. From having to detain or protect people from a drunken crowd to taking part in large scale public order disruptions at the London Marathon and numerous demonstrations. Not only being able to work in high pressure situations but I have been able to successfully hone my conflict management skills, in order to prevent further disruption or breach of the peace.

On occasion I would have to work independently and need to find solutions to rapidly developing situations in order for them not to get out of hand.

## Misc

Throughout my life I have been actively involved with volunteer schemes. I would regular assist with the leading of Scout trips (including a 3 week expedition to Nepal) as well as being a main instructor in a newly formed City of London Volunteer Police Cadets scheme aimed at detracting 13-18 year olds from neighbouring boroughs from anti-sociable behaviour.

I also love climbing, it is my other passion besides coding. In addition to going indoor climbing most weeks I try to go on a few trips to North Wales _(or even further afield)_ each year.
